### Additional Information

**Q:** Can you remove the "Sent using ‚ö° AutoMails" label from the bottom?

**Ans:** Well yes, because it's open-source. But you should not, as if you are using the tool to reach out to someone for free, you might as well give a little bit of credit to us. Thanks.

Also, ***While shooting off emails might not feel as guilty as trashing pristine paper, they're kinda the same deal. Your emails hang around on energy-guzzling servers forever. So, think twice: only hit send when it matters, and ditch those email clowns who treat your inbox like a circus.
you don't need a 'happy something' from every brand you've ever bought from. Cut the clutter and reclaim your inbox!***
