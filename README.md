***While shooting off emails might not feel as guilty as trashing pristine paper, they're kinda the same deal. Your emails hang around on energy-guzzling servers forever. So, think twice: only hit send when it matters, and ditch those email clowns who treat your inbox like a circus.
you don't need a 'happy something' from every brand you've ever bought from. Cut the clutter and reclaim your inbox!***
