# Credits

We owe a big thanks to the following institutes/projects for their contributions to our project. Though we're just users, not pals (**no affiliation** with them fr)!

1. **Google:** The entire project runs on Google Apps Script, fetching data from Google Sheets and sending emails with Gmail or Google Workspace IDs.

2. **jQuery:** Making our client-side script code look cleaner.

3. **Quill:** For gathering inputs in HTML form?

4. **Quill Mention:** No need for curly braces when mentioning variables, thanks to this gem!

5. **CK Editor:** Tables and WYSIWYG capabilities smoother than a jazz solo (or quill).

6. **jsDelivr:** Hosting CDNs?

7. **OpenAI:** Because ain't nobody got time to write paragraphs this long! Cheers to automated text generation! ðŸ¤–ðŸš€
